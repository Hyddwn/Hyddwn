Official quests use specific id ranges, which are partially important to certain properties of the quest, like icons and tabs, although some of those properties can be customized nowadays, regardless of the id range. At the bottom of the page you can find some references for some known id ranges. Generally you should simply take the official id logged from officials for all quests, unless logging is not viable.

If you need to come up with an id because you don't have it or it's a custom quest, select a certain range above 1,000,000 for core quests and above 2,000,000 for your own quests. Ideally you want to stick to that range for all your quests, to limit the risk of collisions. For example, if you "claim" 2,040,000~2,049,999 you have plenty to work with, and others who see you using that range can take another one.
